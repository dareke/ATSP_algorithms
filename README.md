# ATSP_algorithms
My implementation of chosen algorithms to solve travelling salesman problem.
Each algorithm is written seperately in named file.
## Instruction
To work program needs config file that stores algorithm arguments. Structure of the file varies for different algorithms.
### Random
### Brute Force
### Nearest Neighbor
### Branch&Bound algorithms
### Tabu Search
### Ant Colony Optimization
